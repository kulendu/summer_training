      <h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
        <br>
        The topic of our problem is “Juvenile Delinquency”.Juvenile crime occurs when minors violate a criminal statute. 
        When a juvenile commits a crime, the procedure that takes place differs from that of the adult offender. 
        While it is common for the normal citizens to consider ages between 10-18 as minors but the justice system considers minors even younger as adults,
         if the crime committed is very serious.
         Juvenile crime is also known as Juvenile Offending or youth crime is the participation in the illegal behavior of the minors. 
         Juvenile crime is the legal definition rather than specific behavior or psychiatric syndrome. 
         A juvenile is person detention who is typically under the age of 18 and commits an act that otherwise would have been charged as a crime if they were adult.
         Juvenile crime usually is the participation of the minors of the age between 10-17 years, 
        in illegal behavior or activities.

        <h1 class="how-h1">HOW IS THE PROBLEM RELEVANT FOR THE SOCIETY ?</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="how-box">
      Juvenile delinquency or Juvenile crime is the participation of a minor child, in illegal behaviour or activities. Juvenile delinquency is also used to refer to children who exhibit a persistent behaviour of mischievousness or disobedience, so as to be considered out of parental control, becoming subject to legal action by the judicial system.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Juvenile delinquency is an enormous problem in India by which most of the youth ruin their lives. Because of juvenile crime and related problems youth, their families and the entire society suffer multiple consequences. Not only does the problem affect the victims of the crime, but it also affects the juvenile delinquents family, their future, and the society as a whole. The most obvious people affected by juvenile delinquency are the victims. The most profound consequence of crimes committed by juveniles carries due to socio-economic and psychological problems which reflect on their family members and the society. Due to the psychological problems, sometimes juveniles involved in robberies, rapes and assaults also are significant. With these criminal activities the juveniles habituate to consume alcohol or other drugs. The main objective of this paper is to study the incidence of juvenile delinquency with reference to psychological perspectives. The juvenile who commit serious crimes challenge their future to protest perceived abuses that have been perpetrated against them. This makes them psychological depression and in turn reflects to commit more crimes. In this circumstance the study on incidence of juvenile delinquency is very important to analyse the causes with reference to psychological perspectives and annihilate in the society.

    <div id="what-container">
      <h1 class="what-h1">ALREADY EXISTING SOLUTIONS, IF ANY? ARE THESE SOLUTIONS APPLICABLE IN THE PRESENT SCENARIO?</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="what-box">
      What is Juvenile Delinquency
      <br>
      Actually if we look closely, there are no such specific solutions regarding this Juvenile crime. There are just the Judicial law (juvenile delinquency law), that also came into action on 15 January 2016. But before that no specific laws or proper solutions were enacted. Being a victim of the Juvenile Crime, most of them are underage. So if we take any judicial action against them, it is not a permanent solution to this.

      So, it is better we explain these juveniles what is the main reason for this, give them a pure and strong overview and  make them socially educated so that this can be destroyed not only from the society but from their minds.
    </div>

    <div id="solution-container">
        <h1 class="solution-h1">OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION FOR JUVENILE CRIME</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-box">
      As we know that any crimes prevailing comes from a strong superstitious believe. So accordingly Juvenile crime has also many reasons behind it to prevail: 
      <br> 

      <ul>
        <li>Lack of proper education</li> 
        <li>Violence in the home    </li>
        <li>Peer pressure           </li>
        <li>Lack of moral guidance  </li>
        <li>Socio-economic factors  </li> 
      </ul>
      
      <br>
       
      So if we propose only one solution for this wretched crime it will be not enough. So we have proposed a list of solution in accordance with the causes, and here are they:
      <br>
      <br>

          <div class="card-header" style="font-weight: bold;">REASON 1</div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top  crd-img" src="images/gun-pistol-closeup-macro-wallpaper-preview.jpg"> -->
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Some studies have shown reductions in delinquent behaviour when a teenager drops out of school or when there is no proper amount of education given to the child. So it is most important for a child to get proper education at proper age. So our idea is to provide proper education to the child in the perfect time period so that he/she cannot be taken over by the cruel society. We can include a separate subject or a short chapter which covers all these aspects, so that the child becomes mentally strong to know by himself/herself the differences between the bad and good things.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card border-dark cards">
          <div class="card-header" style="font-weight: bold;">REASON 2</div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top crd-img" src="images/gun-pistol-closeup-macro-wallpaper-preview.jpg"> -->
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">When a child or teen is being physically abused at home it is not unusual for them to act out when away from home. This is generally in the form of more violent crimes against people or property. Assaults of all types of vandalism are often associated with physical abuse at home. So we came across a solution to separate all these children who are physically abused at home and give them proper treatment, so that they can be mentally and physically alright.</p>  
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card border-dark cards">
          <div class="card-header" style="font-weight: bold;">REASON 3</div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top crd-img" src="images/gun-pistol-closeup-macro-wallpaper-preview.jpg"> -->
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Peer group is a social group of people having the same interest, activities and age. Adolescents usually spend more time with peers as compared to adults. And if they are in the wrong peer group then it is not the people who will help the child to shape into a wrong person, but their intensions will definitely do. So we can solve this problem by making them to stay away from these peer groups, but moreover the people involved in these peer groups are also child belonging to different age groups, so we must also try to teach them what’s right and what’s wrong. This way not only the peer pressure will be destroyed but also their mind-set will also be changed.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card border-dark cards">
          <div class="card-header" style="font-weight: bold;">REASON 4</div>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Juvenile delinquency is more common in poorer neighbourhoods. While all neighbourhoods are not exempt from delinquent activities, it is believed they happen more in areas where children feel they must commit crimes to prosper. Theft and similar crimes may actually be a result of necessity and not that of just a petty crime. The only true help for this situation is to make sure that children in these areas have access to what they need and understand that they do not have to commit a crime to get ahead in life. So the main thing we can do is to make this child take into a kind of rehab centre and give them proper guidance, so that they can get over their cruel surrounding circumstances and give them the right moral support.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card border-dark cards">

          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">According to some studies it is found that the main reason for the juvenile crime is the parental behaviour or how parents behave or teach their children, and most of the child are gets affected due to this. So in this case we have to give moral education to their parents and after  that the children needs to be ensured that they receive the right moral knowledge so that they can stop the juvenile crime and become a successful citizen.</p>

    <div id="effective-container" class="effective-container">
      <h1 class="effective-h1">WHY THE PROPOSED SOLUTION IS EFFECTIVE IN NATURE ?</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="effective-box">
      As we have seen that over the past years there have been, many organisations and people providing many effective solutions. But these solutions have been effective for a very short period of time, and after that no such actions are being taken. So we have found such solutions which will be very helpful to the society for decreasing this evil crime and its victim. So we have made particular solutions regarding the main reasons for this Juvenile crime. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Moreover there has been also examples so that these solutions can be easily understandable, which would be very helpful to the society.

    <div id="effects-container" class="effects-container">
      <h1 class="effects-h1">POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="effects-box">
      The proposed solution hopefully can bring a remarkable change in the society, if followed properly. 
      The solutions are accordingly proposed to the main reasons behind society. There have been many cases where the culprit for the juvenile crime is an underage child, and we cannot punish him or beat him up. So we came up with such solutions where the child need not be beaten up, 
      but we can help him/her to understand why this is prevailing and similarly this can be reduced.
    </div>


    <div id="novelty-container" class="novelty-container">
      <h1 class="novelty-h1">NOVELTY AND UNIQUENESS</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="novelty-box">
      The family should have a positive attitude towards life and towards society. Parents and elder siblings should show the children positive values, norms and standards of society. Consequently, the children will be able to show the right behaviour to the society. Family is the role model of every child and model behaviour by the family can give motivation to the child to behave positively. Government should support families that have poor economic status so that they can improve their financial condition. Parents should also teach children the importance of respecting laws of society. Parents should tell their children the consequences of breaking laws that government has made for public safety and betterment. They should make sure that they observe equality of rights, justice and condemn discrimination. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Similarly the moral or uniqueness of our proposed solution is that all these can be softly executable, and no one is harmed during the solution execution process. All the people in the society can be nurtured with high knowledge and most importantly many years after it, the people might change their thoughts about the under estimated crime (juvenile crime).

      The execution strategy should go on as follows:

      <br>
      We must first make these child educated by providing them with proper moral education so that they can easily distinguish between the good and bad. Secondly, the child who are living under unfavourable circumstances, like living in a place where there is people full of thief, pick pockets etc so most likely a good child living there will easily get influenced by them , so we must at first shift them to a good place, and support them by making them understand about the situation. And most importantly, we must organize a kind of NGO which must be giving social knowledge to the child as well as their parent because they are their building block and if they lag proper knowledge then the child will be the most affected.

	    As we know that most of the child these days are directly or indirectly involved in the pressure of the unlikely peer group, so we must first make these child educated by providing them with proper moral education so that they can easily distinguish between the good and bad.

      As we have seen that over the past years there have been many organisations and people providing many effective solutions. But these solutions have been effective for a very short period of time and after that no such actions are being taken. So we have proposed some solutions which will be very helpful to the society in order to decrease this evil crime and its victim. Our proposed solutions target the main reasons for Juvenile crime. The solutions that we have currently come up are briefly described as follows: Lack of education is one of the causes, so they must be provided proper education. Children who are physically abused must be treated properly both physically as well as emotionally. Due to violence at home children become violent, so parents must take care of their behaviour and must behave properly at home as well as outside. Peer groups also play an important role, so parents must decide with what kind of peer groups their children must socialize so that they learn good habits. Children must be encouraged to extend their help in NGOs, orphanages, or to other poor kids and also learn about other good habits like cleanliness and climate change. The neighbourhood of a child also plays a crucial role in his or her behaviour so parents must choose their neighbourhood wisely.
      <br>
      <br>
